# SUMMER ANALYTICS CAPSTONE PROJECT - Dynamic pricing for Urban Parking Lots
In this project I have created an intelligent, data-driven pricing engine for 14 parking spaces using real-time data streams, basic economic theory, and ML models built from scratch, using only numpy, pandas libraries.
I have used data collected from 14 urban parking spaces over 73 days, sampled at 18 time points per day with 30 minutes of time difference (from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM the same day).
The price is realistically updated in real-time based on: Historical occupancy patterns, queue length, nearby traffic, special events, vehicle type.
